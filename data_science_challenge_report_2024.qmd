# Background

This report investigates the impacts of vaccinations amongst the different development regions as we dived into the difference of life expectancy and the global coverage of the vaccination programs. Overall, it aims to act as a resource for NGOs in prioritising what vaccines to distribute, and where, to best increase life expectancy. We used a dataset from OWID (Our World In Data) for vaccination coverage and global life expectancy.  We analysed the trend of the vaccination programs in different regions to deduce the impact of the vaccines and potential life expectancy gains from 1980 to 2021.

We have split up our findings in 2 sections:


- **Impact of Vaccines**: looks into how the different vaccines on different diseases perform in prevention and increasing the global life expectancy.



- **Modelling and Predicting future life expectancy**: looks into the different trends and future projections of life expectancy based on the global vaccination coverage.

We leveraged different methods such as Pearson’s correlation coefficient and linear regression to find the impacts of different vaccinations, and ARIMA, difference of time periods, and ACF and PACF plots to analyse the trends of the time series data on how life expectancy based on the global vaccination coverage. 


# Data

## Life Expectancy Data

[Life Expectancy](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy#all-charts) dataset from Our World in Data.

```{r}
le_df <- read_csv("data/life-expectancy.csv")
paged_table(le_df)
```

### Cleaning life expectancy data

```{r}
le_clean <- janitor::clean_names(le_df)
# rename column
le_clean <- le_clean %>% 
  rename(period_life_expect = period_life_expectancy_at_birth_sex_all_age_0)
paged_table(le_clean)
```

## Global Vaccination Coverage Data

```{r}
vaccination_df <- read_csv("data/global-vaccination-coverage.csv")
vaccination_df %>% paged_table()
```

### Cleaning vaccination data

```{r}
vaccination_clean <- janitor::clean_names(vaccination_df) %>% paged_table()
vaccination_clean
```

# Impact of vacccination

Using a combination of Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression, the vaccines for one dose of Salk's polio vaccine, one dose of the meningococcal vaccine, three doses of the polio vaccine and three doses of the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine were found to be the most significant in increasing life expectancy globally.

```{r}

merged_datasets = merge(vaccination_clean, le_clean, by=c("entity","year"))
names(merged_datasets)[names(merged_datasets) == 'period_life_expect'] <- 'life_expectancy'

```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

ggplot(data=merged_datasets) +
  geom_point(aes(
    x=ipv1_percent_of_one_year_olds_immunized, y=life_expectancy, color=year)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Salk (Polio) 1st Dose") + xlab("% 1yos vaccinated") + ylab("Life Expectancy")

ggplot(data=merged_datasets) +
  geom_point(aes(
    x=pol3_percent_of_one_year_olds_immunized, y=life_expectancy, color=year)) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Polio 3rd Dose") + xlab("% 1yos vaccinated") + ylab("Life Expectancy")

  geom_point(aes(
    x=mcv1_percent_of_one_year_olds_immunized, y=life_expectancy, color=year)) +

  labs(title="Diphtheria 3rd Dose") + xlab("% 1yos vaccinated") + ylab("Life Expectancy")

```

# Time Series Analysis and Modelling

In this section, we will perform a time series analysis on the life expectancy data for three [UN development groups](https://population.un.org/wpp/DefinitionOfRegions/#:~:text=More%20developed%20regions%20comprise%20Europe,plus%20Melanesia%2C%20Micronesia%20and%20Polynesia): least developed countries, less developed regions excluding the least developed countries, and more developed regions. The reason for this is due to the fact that the life expectancy are very different between these regions.

```{r}
development_status <- stringr::str_subset(le_clean$entity, regex("devel", ignore_case = TRUE)) %>% unique()

development_status <- c("Least developed countries", "Less developed regions, excluding least developed countries", "More developed regions")

p <- le_clean %>%
  filter(entity %in% development_status) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, 
             y = period_life_expect,
             color = entity)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy by Year",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Life Expectancy at Birth (years)")
ggplotly(p)
```


## Building ARIMA model

Now, we use `auto.arima` to fit best ARIMA model for each group using life expectancy data from 1950 onward, and then forecast the life expectancy for the next 5 years.

###  Convert dataframes to time series

```{r}
# create a list of 3 dataframes
le_dev_ls <- list()
for (dev in development_status) {
  le_dev_ls[[dev]] <- le_clean %>% 
    filter(entity == dev) %>%
    select(period_life_expect) %>%
    ts(start = 1950, end = 2021)
}
# le_dev_ls
```

## Fit best ARIMA models

```{r}
# install.packages("forecast")
library(forecast)
le_dev_opt <- list()
for (dev in development_status) {
  le_dev_opt[[dev]] <- auto.arima(le_dev_ls[[dev]])
}
le_dev_opt
```

## Validate ARIMA models

The `auto.arima` function found the best ARIMA model for each group as follows:

- Least developed countries: ARIMA(0,1,2)
- Less developed regions, excluding least developed countries: ARIMA(2,1,0)
- More developed regions: ARIMA(0,2,1)

We can also use the `sarima` function to check if the residuals are white noise (no trend), the ACF of residuals are not significant, p-values of Ljung-Box test are greater than 0.05.

```{r}
library(astsa)

sarima(le_dev_ls$`Least developed countries`, 0, 1, 2)
sarima(le_dev_ls$`Less developed regions, excluding least developed countries`, 2, 1, 0)
sarima(le_dev_ls$`More developed regions`, 0, 2, 1)
```

## Forecast the life expectancy for the next 5 years

According to the ARIMA model, the life expectancy of least developed countries and less developed regions are expected to increase in the next 5 years whereas that of more developed regions is expected to decrease. However, the downside of this model is that it assume life expectancy of this year is only dependent on life expectancy in previous years, and does not take into account the external effect such as COVID pandemic since 2019.


```{r warning=FALSE}
p1 <- le_dev_opt$`Least developed countries` %>% 
  forecast(h = 5) %>% 
  autoplot() +
  ggtitle("5 Years Forecast for Least Developed Countries") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy")

p2 <- le_dev_opt$`Less developed regions, excluding least developed countries` %>%
  forecast(h = 5) %>% 
  autoplot() +
  ggtitle("5 Years Forecast for Less Developed Regions (Excluding Least Developed Countries)") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy")

p3 <- le_dev_opt$`More developed regions` %>%
  forecast(h = 5) %>% 
  autoplot() +
  ggtitle("5 Years Forecast for More Developed Regions") +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Life Expectancy")

p1
p2
p3
```
